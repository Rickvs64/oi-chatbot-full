# oi-chatbot-full
Full Open Innovation project "Emotional Chatbot", including docs and setup.

This repository is designed for migration to FHICT's gitlab environment.
The separate repositories are also available at:
Front-end: https://github.com/Rickvs64/oi-frontend_new
Back-end: https://github.com/Rickvs64/OI-Chatbot

Note that the current front-end is built with showcasing in mind (utilizing multiple monitors).
For standard (WhatsApp-like) chat interfaces, consider connecting to the existing back-end project with your own custom front-end.
